		<h6>What is RSS?</h6>
		<p>
         RSS (abbreviation for Really Simple Syndication)
         is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works —
         such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video —
         in a standardized format. An RSS document ("feed", "web feed", or "channel")
         includes full or summarized text, plus metadata
         such as publishing dates and authorship.
         Web feeds benefit publishers by letting them
         syndicate content automatically.
         They benefit readers who want to subscribe to timely updates
         from favored websites or to aggregate feeds from many sites into one place.
         RSS feeds can be read using software called an
         "RSS reader", "feed reader", or
         "aggregator", which can be web-based, desktop-based,
         mobile device or any computerized Internet-connected device.</p>

		<h6>What is RSS reader?</h6>
		<p>Aggregators reduce the time and effort needed to regularly check
         websites for updates, creating a unique information space
         or "personal newspaper." Once subscribed to a feed,
         an aggregator is able to check for new content at user-determined intervals
         and retrieve the update. The content is sometimes described as being "pulled"
         to the subscriber, as opposed to "pushed" with email or IM.
         Unlike recipients of some "pushed" information,
         the aggregator user can easily unsubscribe from a feed.</p>
